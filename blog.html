                    <h1>Some more details about me...</h1>
                    <h2>MTech CSE from IIT Patna</h2>
                    <p>Born and brought up in Mumbai I completed my schooling from St. John's High School, Marol. Secured 93.09% in SSC.
                        I completed HSC from KJ Somaiya Junior College, Vidyavihar with 93.38%. Having a passion for technology and the zeal to upskilling myself everyday, I opted for Computer Engineering.
                        Cleared B.E. in Computer Engineering from VESIT, Chembur in 2091 with 9.51 CGPA. Got selected in campus placements for JP Morgan Chase!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I worked in JPMC's Athena(Python) based projects for their Corporate & Investment banking domain as a Software Engineer. Met amazing people, had an enriching experience.
                        As I wanted to gain more knowledge in the field of Machine Learning, I decided to pursue Masters. I simultaneously prepared for GATE exam along with my full time job.
                        Secured All India Rank of 760 in GATE 2021! This was my second attempt at the exam(secured AIR 4434 in the first). Left the job, went ahead to pursue MTech from IIT Patna.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although unconventional, do I regret this descision? Not at all! The two years of MTech provided such wonderful insights in the field of ML, AI, Deep Learning, NLP, Computer Vision and what not!
                        You can have a look at my projects in the "Projects" tab. I also had a chance to intern with CRISIL as a Data Science intern during Masters. I worked on their Automated Taxonomy Generation Project.
                        Read a lot of reasearch papers, implemented couple of them there. Again, lot of knowledge gain. Completed my MTech with a CGPA of 9.16 along with a campus placement at Oracle.
                        Would be joining their Database department in August. Looking forward to plenty of learning and upskilling...
